Swagger
----------------------------------------------
Swagger is the standard way of documenting the Standard APIs. 
Swagger is primarily used for documenting API.
It is very important to document the APIs; if you want APIs to be consumed and properly used.

Swagger is a framework for describing and documenting RESTful APIs. 
It simplifies the development process by providing tools for designing, building, and consuming APIs. With Swagger, API creators can generate interactive documentation, client SDKs, and server stubs automatically.
The documentation follows the OpenAPI Specification (OAS), which is a standard format for describing REST APIs.

Key components of Swagger include:

Swagger UI: Provides a visual interface for interacting with the API, allowing users to try out endpoints directly from the browser.

Swagger Editor: A web-based editor for writing OpenAPI definitions and creating API documentation.

Swagger Codegen: A tool that generates client libraries, server stubs, and API documentation from OpenAPI definitions.

OpenAPI Specification (OAS): A standard specification for describing RESTful APIs, including details like endpoints, HTTP methods, request/response models, and authentication methods.

The OpenAPI Specification allows you to define your APIâ€™s structure in a JSON or YAML format, which can be consumed by different tools to automate various parts of the API lifecycle, including testing, documentation, and client integration.
